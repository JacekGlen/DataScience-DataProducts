## Introduction


This presents storm data from 1950 till 2011. Full presentation is available at [shinyapps.io](https://jacekglen.shinyapps.io/DataProductsProj/).

The Storm Events Database contains the records used to create the official NOAA Storm Data publication, documenting:

* The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce;
* Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and
* Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.

The database currently contains data from January 1950 to December 2015, as entered by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS). NCEI has performed data reformatting and standardization of event types but has not changed any data values for locations, fatalities, injuries, damage, narratives and any other event specific information.

## Collection Source
The data collection methods have changed substantially over time. Prior to 1993, the records are extracted from the manually typed Storm Data Publication. From 1993 to the present the Storm Data Publication was built from the digital records in the database.
